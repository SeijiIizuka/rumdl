# MD045 - Images Should Have Alternate Text

## Description

This rule is triggered when an image is missing alternate text (alt text). Alt text is important for accessibility, as it provides a textual description of the image for screen readers, users with slow connections, or when images fail to load. It's also valuable for SEO purposes.

Every image in a Markdown document should have descriptive alt text that explains the purpose or content of the image, rather than just having empty brackets.

## Configuration

This rule has no configurable options.

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
![A cat sitting on a window sill](images/cat.jpg)

![Architecture diagram showing system components](diagrams/architecture.png)

![Graph of monthly sales data](charts/sales-2023.png)
```

### Invalid

```markdown
![](images/cat.jpg)

![ ](diagrams/architecture.png)

![  ](charts/sales-2023.png)
```

Warnings:
- Line 1: Image should have alternate text
- Line 3: Image should have alternate text
- Line 5: Image should have alternate text

### Fixed

```markdown
![Image description](images/cat.jpg)

![Image description](diagrams/architecture.png)

![Image description](charts/sales-2023.png)
```

Note: The automatic fix adds a generic "Image description" placeholder, which should be replaced with actual descriptive text that accurately represents the image content.

## Special Cases

- This rule only checks for empty alt text in image syntax (`![](image.jpg)` or `![ ](image.jpg)`).
- It doesn't evaluate the quality or accuracy of existing alt text.
- It doesn't check image references (`![alt][ref]`) - only inline image syntax.
- Whitespace-only alt text (`![ ]()`) is considered empty and will trigger a warning.
