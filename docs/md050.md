# MD050 - Strong Emphasis Style

## Description

This rule is triggered when a document contains strong emphasis (bold) that doesn't use a consistent style for the markers. Markdown supports two different styles for strong emphasis:

1. **Double Asterisks**: `**bold text**`
2. **Double Underscores**: `__bold text__`

Using a consistent style for strong emphasis markers throughout a document improves readability and maintainability. This rule helps ensure that all strongly emphasized text in a document follows the same convention.

## Configuration

This rule can be configured to enforce a specific style for strong emphasis markers.

```json
{
  "MD050": {
    "style": "consistent"
  }
}
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `style` | The style to enforce. Can be `consistent`, `asterisk`, or `underscore`. | `consistent` |

- `consistent`: The most frequently used strong emphasis style in the document becomes the expected style for the entire document.
- `asterisk`: All strong emphasis must use double asterisks.
- `underscore`: All strong emphasis must use double underscores.

## Examples

### Valid

Consistent asterisk-style strong emphasis:

```markdown
This is **strongly emphasized text** and here is **more strong emphasis**.

We consistently use **double asterisks** for strong emphasis throughout the document.
```

Consistent underscore-style strong emphasis:

```markdown
This is __strongly emphasized text__ and here is __more strong emphasis__.

We consistently use __double underscores__ for strong emphasis throughout the document.
```

### Invalid

Mixed strong emphasis styles:

```markdown
This is **strongly emphasized text** and here is __more strong emphasis__.

We use a mix of **double asterisks** and __double underscores__ for strong emphasis.
```

Warnings:
- Line 1: Strong emphasis should use asterisks
- Line 3: Strong emphasis should use asterisks

### Fixed

After fixing for asterisk style (if `style` is set to `asterisk`):

```markdown
This is **strongly emphasized text** and here is **more strong emphasis**.

We use a mix of **double asterisks** and **double underscores** for strong emphasis.
```

After fixing for underscore style (if `style` is set to `underscore`):

```markdown
This is __strongly emphasized text__ and here is __more strong emphasis__.

We use a mix of __double asterisks__ and __double underscores__ for strong emphasis.
```

## Special Cases

- The rule only checks strong emphasis (bold), not regular emphasis (italics).
- Escaped markers (`\**` or `\__`) are not considered strong emphasis and are ignored by this rule.
- The rule determines the document's "consistent" style based on the frequency of each style throughout the document.
- Code blocks, code spans, and link URLs are not checked for strong emphasis markers.
- When the asterisk and underscore counts are equal, asterisks are used as the default.
