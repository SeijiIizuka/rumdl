# MD037 - Spaces inside emphasis markers

## Description

This rule ensures that there are no spaces inside emphasis markers (asterisks and underscores). Spaces inside emphasis markers can lead to unexpected rendering in certain Markdown parsers.

## Rationale

When spaces are included inside emphasis markers, the following issues can occur:

1. Some Markdown parsers may not recognize the emphasis and will render the literal markers and text
2. It creates inconsistent styling across the document
3. The rendered output may not match the author's intent

Using consistent emphasis formatting (without spaces) ensures reliable rendering across all Markdown implementations.

## Examples

### Invalid Examples

```markdown
* Emphasis with spaces *
** Strong emphasis with spaces **
_ Emphasis with underscores and spaces _
__ Strong emphasis with underscores and spaces __
```

### Valid Examples

```markdown
*Emphasis without spaces*
**Strong emphasis without spaces**
_Emphasis with underscores without spaces_
__Strong emphasis with underscores without spaces__
```

### Fixed Examples

```markdown
* Emphasis with spaces * => *Emphasis without spaces*
** Strong emphasis with spaces ** => **Strong emphasis without spaces**
_ Emphasis with underscores and spaces _ => _Emphasis with underscores without spaces_
__ Strong emphasis with underscores and spaces __ => __Strong emphasis with underscores without spaces__
```

## Special Cases

### List Markers

The rule differentiates between list markers and emphasis markers:

```markdown
* List item starting with an asterisk (not treated as emphasis)
  * Nested list item (not treated as emphasis)
```

### Code Blocks

Emphasis markers inside code blocks are ignored:

```markdown
```
* This is not treated as emphasis *
```
```

### Inline Code

Emphasis markers inside inline code are also ignored:

```markdown
`* This is not treated as emphasis *`
```

### Punctuation

The rule correctly handles punctuation inside emphasis:

```markdown
* Text with punctuation! * => *Text with punctuation!*
```

### Multiple Emphasis on Same Line

The rule correctly identifies and fixes multiple emphasis issues on the same line:

```markdown
* Text * and ** More text ** => *Text* and **More text**
```

### Mixed Emphasis Types

The rule correctly handles mixed emphasis types on the same line:

```markdown
* Text * and _ More text _ => *Text* and _More text_
```

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options.
