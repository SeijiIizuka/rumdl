# MD037 - Spaces inside emphasis markers

## Description

This rule is triggered when emphasis markers (bold or italic) have spaces between the markers and the text. The rule is designed to maintain consistent formatting of emphasized text throughout Markdown documents.

Emphasis in Markdown is created using asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`):
- Single asterisks or underscores for *italic* text: `*italic*` or `_italic_`
- Double asterisks or underscores for **bold** text: `**bold**` or `__bold__`

When spaces are included between the markers and the text (like `* text *` instead of `*text*`), it can lead to inconsistent rendering across different Markdown processors. Some processors might ignore the emphasis entirely if spaces are included.

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options.

## Examples

### Invalid

```markdown
* Italic with spaces *
** Bold with spaces **
_ Italic with underscores and spaces _
__ Bold with underscores and spaces __
```

### Valid

```markdown
*Italic without spaces*
**Bold without spaces**
_Italic with underscores without spaces_
__Bold with underscores without spaces__
```

### Fixed

When this rule is triggered, the fix will remove the spaces inside the emphasis markers:

```markdown
* Italic with spaces * → *Italic with spaces*
** Bold with spaces ** → **Bold with spaces**
```

## Special Cases

- This rule ignores emphasis markers inside code blocks.
- List markers (lines starting with `*` followed by a space) are not treated as emphasis markers.
- The rule handles both opening and closing spaces (`* text*`, `*text *`, and `* text *`).
- Punctuation adjacent to emphasis text is preserved: `* text! *` becomes `*text!*`.
