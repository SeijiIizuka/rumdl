# MD047 - Files Should End With a Single Newline Character

## Description

This rule is triggered when a file doesn't end with a single newline character. Having files end with a newline is a common convention in text files and provides several benefits:

1. It ensures that every line in the file is terminated properly.
2. It prevents issues with some text processing tools that expect files to end with a newline.
3. It avoids the "No newline at end of file" warning in many version control systems.
4. It makes concatenating files more predictable.

The rule also triggers if a file ends with multiple newline characters, as this creates unnecessary blank lines at the end of the document.

## Configuration

This rule has no configurable options.

## Examples

### Valid

A file ending with exactly one newline character:

```markdown
# Document Title

This is a paragraph.

- List item 1
- List item 2

## Conclusion

This document ends with a single newline.
[Invisible newline character here]
```

### Invalid

A file with no newline at the end:

```markdown
# Document Title

This is a paragraph.

## Conclusion

This document doesn't end with a newline.[No newline here]
```

Warning:
- Line 7: File should end with a single newline character

A file with multiple newlines at the end:

```markdown
# Document Title

This is a paragraph.

## Conclusion

This document ends with multiple newlines.


[Multiple newlines above]
```

Warning:
- Line 7: File should end with a single newline character

### Fixed

The fixed version would ensure exactly one newline character at the end of the file:

```markdown
# Document Title

This is a paragraph.

## Conclusion

This document ends with a single newline.
[Invisible newline character here]
```

## Special Cases

- Empty files are not required to have a newline character.
- The rule checks for the literal newline character (`\n`), not just visual line breaks.
- The check is performed at the very end of the document, ignoring spaces or tabs on the last line.
