# MD023 - Headings must start at the beginning of the line

## Description

This rule checks for headings that are indented with spaces. In Markdown, headings should start at the beginning of the line (column 1) without any leading whitespace. Indented headings might not be recognized as headings by some Markdown parsers, and they can disrupt the document's structure and visual hierarchy.

Both ATX-style headings (`# Heading`) and Setext-style headings (`Heading\n=======`) are checked by this rule.

## Configuration

This rule has no configurable options. It always enforces that headings start at the beginning of the line.

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

Text here

Heading
=======

Another heading
--------------
```

All headings in the example above start at the beginning of the line with no indentation.

### Invalid

```markdown
   # Indented heading
  ## Also indented

  Indented setext heading
  ----------------------
```

These headings are indented with spaces, which violates the rule.

### Fixed

The rule will automatically fix indented headings by removing the leading whitespace:

Before:
```markdown
   # Indented heading
  ## Also indented

  Indented setext heading
  ----------------------
```

After:
```markdown
# Indented heading
## Also indented

Indented setext heading
----------------------
```

## Special Cases

- The rule preserves the content of the heading, including any formatting inside it.
- For closed ATX headings (`# Heading #`), the closing hash marks are preserved.
- For Setext headings, both the heading text and the underline characters are kept aligned at the beginning of their respective lines.
- Content that is indented but is not a heading (such as regular text or code) is not affected by this rule.
