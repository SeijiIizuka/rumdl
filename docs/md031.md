# MD031 - Fenced code blocks should be surrounded by blank lines

## Description

This rule enforces that fenced code blocks are surrounded by blank lines. Fenced code blocks are sections of code that begin and end with three backticks (```) or tildes (~~~). Surrounding these blocks with blank lines improves readability and ensures proper rendering in various Markdown processors.

Adding blank lines before and after code blocks helps visually separate code from surrounding text content, making the document more readable and better structured.

## Configuration

This rule has no configurable options.

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
Text before the code block.

```example
code content here
```

Text after the code block.
```

In the example above, there are blank lines both before and after the fenced code block.

### Invalid

```markdown
Text before the code block.
```example
code content here
```
Text after the code block.
```

The above example is invalid because there are no blank lines surrounding the code block.

```markdown
Text before.
```code
code here
```

More text after.
```

This example has no blank line before or after the code block.

### Fixed

Before:
```markdown
Text before.
```code
code here
```
More text after.
```

After:
```markdown
Text before.

```code
code here
```

More text after.
```

## Special Cases

1. The rule checks for blank lines both before and after code blocks.
2. The rule handles both backtick (```) and tilde (~~~) style code fences.
3. The rule preserves indentation of code blocks.
4. Code blocks at the beginning or end of a document only need one blank line (after or before, respectively).
5. The rule works with code blocks that include language specifications (e.g., ```javascript).
