# MD048 - Code Fence Style

## Description

This rule is triggered when a document contains code fences that don't use a consistent style for their markers. Markdown fenced code blocks can use either backticks (```) or tildes (~~~) as delimiters. For consistency and readability, this rule enforces using the same style throughout a document.

While both styles are valid in Markdown, mixing them can give the impression of inconsistent or careless writing. This rule helps maintain a uniform appearance across your documentation.

## Configuration

This rule can be configured to enforce a specific code fence style.

```json
{
  "MD048": {
    "style": "consistent"
  }
}
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `style` | The style to enforce. Can be `consistent`, `backtick`, or `tilde`. | `consistent` |

- `consistent`: The first code fence style found in the document sets the expected style for the rest of the document.
- `backtick`: All code fences must use backticks (```).
- `tilde`: All code fences must use tildes (~~~).

## Examples

### Valid

Consistent backtick-style code fences:

```markdown
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```
```

Consistent tilde-style code fences:

```markdown
~~~javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
~~~

~~~css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
~~~
```

### Invalid

Mixed code fence styles:

```markdown
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

~~~css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
~~~
```

Warnings:
- Line 6: Code fence style should use backticks
- Line 10: Code fence style should use backticks

### Fixed

After fixing for backtick style (if `style` is set to `backtick`):

```markdown
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```
```

After fixing for tilde style (if `style` is set to `tilde`):

```markdown
~~~javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
~~~

~~~css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
~~~
```

## Special Cases

- The rule determines the document's "consistent" style based on the first code fence encountered.
- Indented code blocks are not affected by this rule.
- If no code fences are present, no warnings will be triggered.
- The rule preserves any language specifiers and attributes on the code fence line.
- Whitespace before the code fence markers is preserved during fixes.
