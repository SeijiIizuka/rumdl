# MD032 - Lists should be surrounded by blank lines

## Description

This rule enforces that lists must be surrounded by blank lines. Markdown lists are blocks of text that begin with a list marker (such as `*`, `-`, `+`, or a number followed by a period) and should be visually separated from surrounding content for better readability and proper rendering.

Adding blank lines before and after lists ensures proper parsing by Markdown processors and creates a cleaner visual structure in the rendered document. Without blank lines, text may not be properly recognized as part of a list or might be incorrectly merged with surrounding paragraphs.

## Configuration

This rule has no configurable options.

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
Some text before the list.

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

Some text after the list.
```

```markdown
Paragraph of text.

1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item
   * Nested unordered item
   * Another nested item
3. Third ordered item

More content here.
```

### Invalid

```markdown
Some text before the list.
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
Some text after the list.
```

In this invalid example, there are no blank lines before or after the list, which makes it harder to read and may cause rendering issues in some Markdown processors.

```markdown
Paragraph of text.
1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item
More content here.
```

### Fixed

Before:
```markdown
Some text before the list.
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
Some text after the list.
```

After:
```markdown
Some text before the list.

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

Some text after the list.
```

## Special Cases

1. The rule checks for blank lines both before and after lists.
2. The rule handles both ordered lists (with numbers) and unordered lists (with `*`, `-`, or `+`).
3. Nested lists are considered part of the parent list and don't require separate blank lines.
4. Lists at the beginning of a document only need a blank line after them.
5. Lists at the end of a document only need a blank line before them.
6. Multiple blank lines surrounding a list are acceptable.
7. Blank lines within a list (between list items) don't affect this rule.
