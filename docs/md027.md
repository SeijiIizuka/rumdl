# MD027 - Multiple spaces after blockquote symbol

## Description

This rule enforces that there should be only a single space after a blockquote symbol (`>`). Multiple spaces between the blockquote symbol and the content are considered a formatting error and should be avoided for consistency.

## Configuration

This rule does not have any configuration options.

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
> This is a properly formatted blockquote
> with a single space after the blockquote symbol
> on each line.
```

### Invalid

```markdown
>  This blockquote has two spaces after the blockquote symbol
>   This line has three spaces
>    This line has four spaces
```

### Fixed

```markdown
> This blockquote has been fixed to have only one space
> This line has been fixed
> This line has been fixed
```

## Special Cases

- The rule checks each line independently, so it will flag multiple spaces on individual lines even if other lines are correctly formatted.
- The rule only applies to the space immediately following the blockquote symbol. Other whitespace within the blockquote content is not affected.
- The rule does not check for consistent indentation of nested blockquotes (use MD027 for that).
