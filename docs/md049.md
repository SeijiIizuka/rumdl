# MD049 - Emphasis Style

## Description

This rule is triggered when a document contains emphasis (italics) that doesn't use a consistent style for the markers. Markdown supports two different styles for emphasis:

1. **Asterisks**: `*emphasized text*`
2. **Underscores**: `_emphasized text_`

Using a consistent style for emphasis markers throughout a document improves readability and maintainability. This rule helps ensure that all emphasized text in a document follows the same convention.

## Configuration

This rule can be configured to enforce a specific style for emphasis markers.

```json
{
  "MD049": {
    "style": "consistent"
  }
}
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `style` | The style to enforce. Can be `consistent`, `asterisk`, or `underscore`. | `consistent` |

- `consistent`: The most frequently used emphasis style in the document becomes the expected style for the entire document.
- `asterisk`: All emphasis must use asterisks.
- `underscore`: All emphasis must use underscores.

## Examples

### Valid

Consistent asterisk-style emphasis:

```markdown
This is *emphasized text* and here is *more emphasized text*.

We consistently use *asterisks* for emphasis throughout the document.
```

Consistent underscore-style emphasis:

```markdown
This is _emphasized text_ and here is _more emphasized text_.

We consistently use _underscores_ for emphasis throughout the document.
```

### Invalid

Mixed emphasis styles:

```markdown
This is *emphasized text* and here is _more emphasized text_.

We use a mix of *asterisks* and _underscores_ for emphasis.
```

Warnings:
- Line 1: Emphasis should use asterisks
- Line 3: Emphasis should use asterisks

### Fixed

After fixing for asterisk style (if `style` is set to `asterisk`):

```markdown
This is *emphasized text* and here is *more emphasized text*.

We use a mix of *asterisks* and *underscores* for emphasis.
```

After fixing for underscore style (if `style` is set to `underscore`):

```markdown
This is _emphasized text_ and here is _more emphasized text_.

We use a mix of _asterisks_ and _underscores_ for emphasis.
```

## Special Cases

- The rule only checks single emphasis (italics), not strong emphasis (bold).
- Escaped markers (`\*` or `\_`) are not considered emphasis and are ignored by this rule.
- The rule determines the document's "consistent" style based on the frequency of each style throughout the document.
- Code blocks, code spans, and link URLs are not checked for emphasis markers.
- When the asterisk and underscore counts are equal, asterisks are used as the default.
