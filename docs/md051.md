# MD051 - Link Fragments Should Be Valid

## Description

This rule ensures that link fragments (the part after the # in a link) point to valid headings in the  
document. This helps prevent broken internal links and improves navigation within Markdown documents.

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
# Introduction

## Getting Started

[Link to Getting Started](#getting-started)
```

### Invalid

```markdown
# Introduction

## Getting Started

[Link to non-existent heading](#installation)
```

### Fixed

```markdown
# Introduction

## Getting Started

## Installation

[Link to Installation](#installation)
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options.

## Special Cases

- This rule only applies to internal links with fragments (links that start with #)
- It does not apply to external links (links to other documents or websites)
- The rule checks if the fragment matches a heading in the document
- Heading IDs are generated by converting the heading text to lowercase and replacing spaces with hyphens
- Special characters in headings are removed when generating IDs
- The rule handles complex headings with punctuation, code spans, and emphasis
