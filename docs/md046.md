# MD046 - Code Block Style

## Description

This rule is triggered when a document contains code blocks that don't use a consistent style. Markdown supports two different styles for code blocks:

1. **Fenced code blocks** use triple backticks (```) or tildes (~~~) to define the beginning and end of the block.
2. **Indented code blocks** use four spaces at the beginning of each line.

Using a consistent style throughout a document improves readability and maintainability. This rule helps ensure that all code blocks in a document follow the same convention.

## Configuration

This rule can be configured to enforce a specific code block style.

```json
{
  "MD046": {
    "style": "consistent"
  }
}
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `style` | The style to enforce. Can be `consistent`, `fenced`, or `indented`. | `consistent` |

- `consistent`: The first code block style found in the document sets the expected style for the rest of the document.
- `fenced`: All code blocks must use the fenced style.
- `indented`: All code blocks must use the indented style.

## Examples

### Valid

Consistent fenced code blocks:

```markdown
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```
```

Consistent indented code blocks:

```markdown
    function hello() {
      console.log("Hello, world!");
    }
    
    body {
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
    }
```

### Invalid

Mixed code block styles:

```markdown
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

    body {
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
    }
```

Warnings:
- Line 6: Code block style should be fenced

### Fixed

After fixing for fenced style (if `style` is set to `fenced`):

```markdown
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```
```

After fixing for indented style (if `style` is set to `indented`):

```markdown
    function hello() {
      console.log("Hello, world!");
    }
    
    body {
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
    }
```

## Special Cases

- The rule determines the document's "consistent" style based on the first code block encountered.
- Code blocks inside other blocks (like blockquotes) are also checked.
- When converting between styles, language information in fenced blocks might be lost when converting to indented style.
- When fixing indented blocks to fenced style, the tool adds fence markers but doesn't specify a language.
