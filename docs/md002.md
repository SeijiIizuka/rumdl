# MD002 - First Heading Should Be Top Level

**Rule Type**: `warning`

**Default Level**: `1` (h1)

## Description

This rule checks that the first heading in a document is a top-level heading (h1 by default). The level can be customized using the rule's configuration.

## Examples

### ❌ Incorrect

```markdown
## Second Level Heading
### Third Level Heading

Heading
-------
```

### ✓ Correct

```markdown
# First Level Heading
## Second Level Heading

Heading
=======
```

## Configuration

The rule can be configured with a custom level:

```json
{
  "MD002": {
    "level": 2
  }
}
```

This would make level 2 (h2) the required level for the first heading.

## Rationale

Having a consistent top-level heading helps maintain a clear document hierarchy and improves document structure. This is particularly important for accessibility and document outline generation.
