# MD035 - Horizontal rule style

## Description

This rule ensures that horizontal rules (dividers) in a Markdown document use a consistent style. Horizontal rules can be created using three or more asterisks (`*`), hyphens (`-`), or underscores (`_`), with or without spaces between them. For consistency within a document, this rule enforces a specific horizontal rule style.

The default style is three hyphens (`---`) without spaces, which is widely used and compatible with most Markdown parsers.

## Configuration

The rule can be configured with a specific horizontal rule style:

```json
{
  "MD035": {
    "style": "---"
  }
}
```

Possible values for `style` include:
- `---` (three hyphens, default)
- `***` (three asterisks)
- `___` (three underscores)
- Or any other valid horizontal rule format (e.g., `- - -`, `* * *`)

## Examples

### Valid

With default configuration (`style: "---"`):

```markdown
Some text

---

More text
```

With custom configuration (`style: "***"`):

```markdown
Some text

***

More text
```

### Invalid

With default configuration (`style: "---"`):

```markdown
Some text

***

More text

___

Final text
```

In this example, both `***` and `___` would be flagged as incorrect since they don't match the expected style of `---`.

### Fixed

Before:
```markdown
Some text

***

More text

___

Final text
```

After (with default configuration):
```markdown
Some text

---

More text

---

Final text
```

## Special Cases

1. The rule only checks lines that are valid horizontal rules. A line must consist of three or more of the same character (`*`, `-`, or `_`), optionally with spaces between them.

2. Lines that mix different characters (like `*-*-*`) are not considered valid horizontal rules and are not checked by this rule.

3. The rule handles horizontal rules at the beginning or end of a document the same way as those in the middle.

4. The rule preserves the surrounding blank lines when applying fixes.

5. Indented horizontal rules are still identified and checked for consistency.
