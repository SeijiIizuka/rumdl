# MD005 - List Indentation

This rule enforces consistent indentation for list items at each level.

## Description

Lists in Markdown should have consistent indentation at each level. This means:
- All list items at the same level should have the same indentation
- Nested list items should be indented consistently relative to their parent
- The rule applies to both ordered and unordered lists
- Mixed list types (ordered and unordered) at the same level should have the same indentation

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options. It enforces:
- 0 spaces for top-level list items
- 2 spaces per level for nested items (both ordered and unordered lists)

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Nested 1
  * Nested 2
* Item 3

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
  1. Nested 1
  2. Nested 2
3. Item 3

* Item 1
  * Nested 1
    * Deep nested
  * Back to level 2
    1. Mixed ordered list
    2. Same level
* Back to top
```

### Invalid

```markdown
* Item 1
 * Item 2 (wrong indentation)
   * Nested 1

* Item 1
  * Nested 1
   * Nested 2 (inconsistent with sibling)
* Item 2

* Item 1
   * Level 2 (should be 2 spaces)
      * Level 3 (should be 4 spaces)
```

### Fixed

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Nested 1

* Item 1
  * Nested 1
  * Nested 2
* Item 2

* Item 1
  * Level 2
    * Level 3
```
