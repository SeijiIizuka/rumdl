# MD017 - No Emphasis As Heading

This rule enforces that emphasis (bold or italic) should not be used as a heading.

## Description
Headings in Markdown should use proper heading syntax (`#`, `##`, etc.) rather than emphasis markers (`*`, `_`, `**`, `__`) for better accessibility and document structure. This rule ensures that lines containing only emphasized text are not used as headings.

## Configuration
- `allow_emphasis_headings`: Whether to allow emphasis-only lines to be used as headings (default: false)

## Examples

### Valid
```markdown
# Main Heading
## Sub Heading
### Third Level

Some text with *italic* and **bold** emphasis.

A line with *multiple* **emphasis** markers.
```

### Invalid
```markdown
*Emphasized Heading*

**Bold Heading**

_Another Heading_

__Yet Another Heading__
```

### Fixed
```markdown
# Emphasized Heading

## Bold Heading

### Another Heading

#### Yet Another Heading
```

### Special Cases
- Only applies to lines containing nothing but emphasized text
- Ignores lines with multiple emphasis markers
- Ignores lines with non-emphasized text
- Considers both asterisk and underscore emphasis
- Handles both single and double emphasis markers
- Preserves emphasis in regular text
