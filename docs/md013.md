# MD013 - Line Length

This rule enforces a maximum line length to ensure readability.

## Description
Long lines can be hard to read and may not display properly in all environments. This rule helps maintain consistent line lengths throughout the document.

## Configuration
- `line_length`: Maximum line length (default: 80)
- `code_blocks`: Whether to enforce line length in code blocks (default: true)
- `tables`: Whether to enforce line length in tables (default: false)
- `headings`: Whether to enforce line length in headings (default: true)
- `strict`: Whether to enforce line length strictly or allow exceptions (default: false)

## Examples

### Valid
```markdown
This is a line that is well within the maximum length limit.

And here's another line that doesn't exceed the limit.
```

### Invalid
```markdown
This is a very long line that exceeds the maximum length limit and should be wrapped to improve readability and ensure proper display in all environments.

Here's another extremely long line that goes beyond the recommended length and should be split into multiple lines for better formatting.
```

### Fixed
```markdown
This is a very long line that exceeds the maximum length limit and should be
wrapped to improve readability and ensure proper display in all environments.

Here's another extremely long line that goes beyond the recommended length and
should be split into multiple lines for better formatting.
```

### Special Cases
- When `code_blocks` is false, code blocks are not checked for line length
- When `tables` is false, table lines are not checked for length
- When `headings` is false, heading lines are not checked for length
- When `strict` is false, certain exceptions are allowed:
  - URLs on their own line
  - Code blocks with long strings
  - Table cells that can't be wrapped
  - Long image references
  - Long link references
