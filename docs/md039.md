# MD039 - No Space in Links

## Description

This rule checks for spaces inside link text in Markdown documents. In Markdown, link text should not have leading or trailing spaces, as these can lead to inconsistent rendering across different Markdown processors.

The rule ensures that link text follows the format `[text](url)` without spaces directly after the opening bracket or before the closing bracket. Spaces within the link text itself are preserved, as these are considered part of the displayed text.

## Configuration

This rule has no configurable options.

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
[This is a longer link text](https://example.com)
[Link with spaces in the middle](https://example.com)
```

These links follow the correct format without spaces immediately after the opening bracket or before the closing bracket.

### Invalid

```markdown
[ Link text](https://example.com)
[Link text ](https://example.com)
[ Link text ](https://example.com)
```

In these examples, there are spaces inside the brackets that should be removed for consistent rendering.

### Fixed

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
[Link text](https://example.com)
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

The fix removes the leading and trailing spaces from the link text while preserving the text content.

## Special Cases

1. **Code Blocks**: Spaces in links within code blocks are ignored, as these are often examples:

   ```markdown
   Code block with [ spaced link ](url) that is ignored
   ```

2. **Multiple Links**: The rule correctly processes multiple links on the same line:

   ```markdown
   [ Link one ](url1) and [ link two ](url2)
   ```

3. **Internal Spaces**: Spaces within the link text are preserved, as they are part of the display text:

   ```markdown
   [This is a proper link with spaces inside](url)
   ```

4. **Punctuation**: The rule correctly handles punctuation inside link text:

   ```markdown
   [ Link with exclamation! ](url)
   ```
