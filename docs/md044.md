# MD044 - Proper Names Should Have the Correct Capitalization

## Description

This rule ensures that proper names, such as product names, brand names, or technologies, are consistently capitalized throughout your Markdown documents. Correct and consistent capitalization of proper names makes documents appear more professional and ensures brand names are represented as intended.

For example, it can ensure that "JavaScript", "GitHub", or "PostgreSQL" are always written with the correct capitalization, rather than variants like "javascript", "github", or "postgresql".

## Configuration

This rule requires configuration to specify the proper names and their correct capitalization:

```json
{
  "names": ["JavaScript", "GitHub", "Node.js", "React", "TypeScript"],
  "code_blocks_excluded": true
}
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `names` | Array of proper names with their correct capitalization | `[]` (empty array) |
| `code_blocks_excluded` | Whether to exclude code blocks from this rule | `true` |

## Examples

### Valid

With configuration `names: ["JavaScript", "GitHub"]`:

```markdown
JavaScript is a popular programming language.

Visit GitHub to browse more open-source projects.

The API supports both CommonJS and ES modules.
```

### Invalid

With the same configuration:

```markdown
Javascript is a great language for web development.

Check out our repository on github for examples.

The javascript code should run in any modern browser.
```

Will generate warnings:
- Line 1: Proper name 'Javascript' should be 'JavaScript'
- Line 3: Proper name 'github' should be 'GitHub'
- Line 5: Proper name 'javascript' should be 'JavaScript'

### Fixed

After fixing:

```markdown
JavaScript is a great language for web development.

Check out our repository on GitHub for examples.

The JavaScript code should run in any modern browser.
```

## Special Cases

- The rule performs case-insensitive matching but replaces with the exact capitalization specified.
- Word boundaries are respected, so "JavaScript" won't match "javascript" inside other words like "typescriptjavascript".
- When `code_blocks_excluded` is enabled (the default), proper names inside code blocks (fenced with ``` or indented with 4 spaces) are not checked.
- The rule applies to all proper names in the configured list, regardless of context.
- Names with special characters or punctuation (like "Node.js") are properly handled.
- The rule does not enforce capitalization rules on words not in the configured list.
