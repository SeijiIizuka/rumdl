# MD042 - No Empty Links

## Description

This rule checks for empty links in Markdown documents. An empty link is one with no content (text) or no destination (URL). Empty links serve no purpose in a document, can confuse readers, and may indicate unfinished content.

Valid links in Markdown should have both descriptive text and a working URL. This rule helps identify links that were either left incomplete during drafting or where the text or URL was accidentally removed.

## Configuration

This rule has no configurable options.

## Examples

### Valid

Links with both text and URL:

```markdown
[Visit our website](https://example.com)
[Documentation](./docs/readme.md)
[Contact Us](mailto:info@example.com)
```

### Invalid

Links missing text or URL:

```markdown
[](https://example.com)
[Empty URL]()
[ ](https://example.com)
[Visit our website]()
```

These examples show links with empty text, empty URLs, or both.

### Fixed

The fix for this rule removes the empty links entirely:

Before:
```markdown
Check out our [](https://example.com) and [Empty URL]() for more information.
```

After:
```markdown
Check out our  and  for more information.
```

Note that while the fix removes the empty links, you may need to manually adjust the surrounding text for clarity.

## Special Cases

- The rule considers a link to be empty if either the text part `[]` or the URL part `()` is empty.
- Whitespace-only text (e.g., `[ ]`) is considered empty.
- Whitespace-only URLs (e.g., `( )`) are considered empty.
- The rule does not check reference-style links (e.g., `[text][ref]`).
- The rule does not check autolinks enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<https://example.com>`).
- The fix simply removes the entire empty link, including both text and URL parts.
