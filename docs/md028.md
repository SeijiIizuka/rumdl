# MD028 - No blank lines inside blockquotes

## Description

This rule is triggered when there are blank lines inside blockquotes without a blockquote marker ('>') on them. According to the [CommonMark spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#block-quotes), blank lines inside blockquotes should still have a blockquote marker ('>'). Without this marker, what would appear to be a single blockquote in the Markdown source will render as multiple blockquotes separated by spaces when converted to HTML.

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options.

## Examples

### Invalid

```markdown
> This is a blockquote
> which spans multiple lines

> with a blank line in between.
```

This creates two separate blockquotes rather than a single blockquote with a space.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote
> which spans multiple lines

> and has two blank lines


> between content.
```

Multiple blank lines without blockquote markers also trigger this rule.

```markdown
> This is a nested blockquote
> > with a nested quote
>
> > and a blank line between them.
```

Blank lines in nested blockquotes should also have the appropriate markers.

### Valid

```markdown
> This is a blockquote
> which spans multiple lines
>
> with a blank line that has a blockquote marker.
```

```markdown
> This is a blockquote
>
> With multiple blank lines
>
>
> All with blockquote markers.
```

```markdown
> This is a nested blockquote
> > with a nested quote
> >
> > and proper markers on blank lines.
```

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.

> This is a separate blockquote.
```

Separate blockquotes with blank lines between them are valid.

### Fixed

Before:
```markdown
> This is a blockquote
> which spans multiple lines

> with a blank line in between.
```

After:
```markdown
> This is a blockquote
> which spans multiple lines
>
> with a blank line in between.
```

## Special Cases

- The rule identifies blockquote lines by checking for lines starting with '>' (potentially with indentation).
- Nested blockquotes (lines with multiple '>' characters) are properly supported.
- The rule carefully distinguishes between blank lines within a blockquote and blank lines between separate blockquotes.
- Indented blockquotes are also properly handled.
