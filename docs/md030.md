# MD030 - Spaces after list markers

## Description

This rule checks for the number of spaces after list markers in both ordered and unordered lists. Consistent spacing improves readability and maintains uniform rendering across different Markdown processors.

## Configuration

The rule can be configured with the following options:

```json
{
  "MD030": {
    "ul_single": 1,     // Spaces after unordered list marker for single-line items
    "ul_multi": 1,      // Spaces after unordered list marker for multi-line items
    "ol_single": 1,     // Spaces after ordered list marker for single-line items
    "ol_multi": 1       // Spaces after ordered list marker for multi-line items
  }
}
```

By default, all values are set to 1 space.

## Examples

### Valid

**Default configuration (1 space)**:

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

**Custom configuration with multi-line items**:

With configuration `{ "ul_multi": 2, "ol_multi": 3 }`:

```markdown
* Single-line item (1 space)
*  Multi-line item (2 spaces)
   continued on the next line

1. Single-line item (1 space)
1.   Multi-line item (3 spaces)
     continued on the next line
```

### Invalid

```markdown
*  Item with 2 spaces (when 1 is expected)
-   Item with 3 spaces (when 1 is expected)

1.  Ordered item with 2 spaces (when 1 is expected)
2.   Ordered item with 3 spaces (when 1 is expected)
```

### Fixed

```markdown
* Item with 2 spaces (when 1 is expected)
- Item with 3 spaces (when 1 is expected)

1. Ordered item with 2 spaces (when 1 is expected)
2. Ordered item with 3 spaces (when 1 is expected)
```

## Special Cases

1. **Code Blocks**: The rule ignores list markers that appear inside code blocks.
2. **Multi-line Items**: List items that span multiple lines can have different spacing requirements than single-line items.
3. **Nesting**: The rule correctly handles nested lists, applying the appropriate spacing rule based on the list type and whether it's a multi-line item.
4. **Preservation**: The rule preserves indentation of list items and only adjusts the spaces between the list marker and the content.
