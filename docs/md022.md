# MD022 - Headings Should Be Surrounded By Blank Lines

This rule enforces that all headings should be surrounded by blank lines, except at the beginning of the document.

## Description
For better readability and consistent rendering, all headings in Markdown should have a blank line both before and after them. The only exception is when a heading appears at the beginning of the document, in which case it doesn't need a blank line before it.

## Configuration
- `lines_above`: Number of blank lines that should be present above each heading (default: 1)
- `lines_below`: Number of blank lines that should be present below each heading (default: 1)

## Examples

### Valid
```markdown
# Heading 1

Some content here.

## Heading 2

More content here.

### Heading 3

Final content.
```

### Invalid
```markdown
# Heading 1
Some content here.
## Heading 2
More content here.
### Heading 3
Final content.

# Another Heading
Content right after.
## Yet Another Heading
No blank line above.
```

### Fixed
```markdown
# Heading 1

Some content here.

## Heading 2

More content here.

### Heading 3

Final content.

# Another Heading

Content right after.

## Yet Another Heading

No blank line above.
```

### Special Cases
- First heading in the document doesn't require a blank line above
- Last heading in the document still requires a blank line below
- Applies to both ATX and Setext-style headings
- Ignores headings in code blocks
- Handles multiple consecutive headings correctly
- Preserves indentation
- Handles empty headings
- Considers YAML front matter boundaries
