# MD040 - Fenced Code Blocks Should Have a Language Specified

## Description

This rule enforces that fenced code blocks in Markdown documents should specify a language. Fenced code blocks are sections of code enclosed by triple backticks (```) or tildes (~~~). Adding a language identifier immediately after the opening fence enables proper syntax highlighting, improving readability of code examples.

Specifying a language for code blocks has several benefits:
- Enables syntax highlighting in rendered Markdown
- Improves accessibility for screen readers
- Allows for better code parsing and processing
- Makes the content more searchable and categorizable

## Configuration

This rule has no configurable options. It simply checks whether each fenced code block includes a language specification.

## Examples

### Valid

With language specified:

```markdown
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```
```

### Invalid

Without language specified:

```markdown
```
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

~~~
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
~~~
```

### Fixed

When fixing violations of this rule, `text` is added as the default language specification:

Before:
```markdown
```
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
```

After:
```markdown
```text
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
```

## Special Cases

- Both backtick (```) and tilde (~~~) style code fences are checked.
- Indented code blocks (blocks of text indented by 4 spaces or 1 tab) are not affected by this rule.
- The fix preserves the content of the code block and only modifies the opening fence line.
- For code blocks that don't represent any specific language, using `text` is recommended as it indicates plain text content.
- The rule only checks for the presence of a language specifier, not its validity or if it's recognized by any specific syntax highlighter.
