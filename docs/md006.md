# MD006 - Consider starting bulleted lists at the beginning of the line

This rule enforces that all bulleted lists start at the beginning of the line.

## Description

Bulleted lists should start at the beginning of the line (indent level 0) to maintain consistent formatting and readability. This rule helps ensure that top-level list items are not indented.

## Configuration

This rule has no configuration options. It enforces:
- All top-level bulleted lists must start at column 1
- Nested list items can be indented as per MD005 and MD007 rules

## Examples

* Item 1

### Invalid

```markdown
  * Item 1
  * Item 2
