# MD008 - Unordered List Style

## Description

This rule enforces consistency in unordered list marker styles within a Markdown document. Markdown supports three different markers for unordered lists: asterisks (`*`), plus signs (`+`), and hyphens (`-`). For better readability and consistency, this rule enforces that all unordered list items use the same marker style throughout the document.

By default, the rule enforces the use of asterisks (`*`) for all unordered list items, but this can be configured to use any of the three supported marker styles.

## Configuration

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `style` | The marker style to enforce (`*`, `+`, or `-`) | `*` |

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "MD008": {
    "style": "-"
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Valid

When using the default configuration (asterisk style):

```markdown
* Item 1
  * Item 2
    * Item 3
```

### Invalid

Mixed marker styles:

```markdown
* Item 1
  + Item 2
    - Item 3
```

These will trigger warnings as they use different marker styles.

### Fixed

After fixing, all markers will be consistent:

```markdown
* Item 1
  * Item 2
    * Item 3
```

## Special Cases

- The rule checks each line independently and only looks for unordered list markers at the beginning of lines.
- Nested list items at different indentation levels are still checked for consistent marker style.
- The rule does not check ordered lists (numbered lists).
- List markers within code blocks are not checked.
- The rule does not enforce consistent indentation (see MD007 for that).
