# MD033 - No inline HTML

## Description

This rule is triggered when inline HTML tags are used in the Markdown document. By default, no HTML tags are allowed, though you can configure specific tags to be permitted.

Markdown is designed to be a plain text format that can be converted to HTML, but it also allows for raw HTML to be included when necessary. However, using inline HTML can make documents less portable and harder to read. This rule helps maintain clean Markdown content by discouraging or limiting the use of HTML tags.

## Configuration

This rule can be configured with an array of allowed HTML tag names:

```json
{
  "MD033": {
    "allowed_elements": ["b", "i", "summary", "details"]
  }
}
```

By default, `allowed_elements` is an empty array, meaning no HTML tags are allowed.

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
# Regular Markdown heading

This is **bold** and _italic_ text.

* List item 1
* List item 2

> This is a blockquote
```

With custom configuration allowing certain elements:

```markdown
# Regular Markdown 

This is some <b>bold</b> text using an allowed tag.
```

Where the configuration specifies `"allowed_elements": ["b"]`.

### Invalid

```markdown
# Heading with <span style="color: red">colored</span> text

<div class="container">
  This is a div container
</div>

Here's some <b>bold</b> text.
```

This example contains multiple HTML tags (`span`, `div`, and `b`), all of which would be flagged by the default configuration.

### Fixed

The rule does not provide automatic fixes, as choosing the appropriate Markdown equivalent requires human judgment. The HTML would need to be manually replaced with Markdown syntax:

Before:
```markdown
# Heading with <span style="color: red">colored</span> text

<div class="container">
  This is a div container
</div>

Here's some <b>bold</b> text.
```

After (manual fix):
```markdown
# Heading with colored text

This is a div container

Here's some **bold** text.
```

## Special Cases

1. The rule ignores HTML tags inside code blocks or code spans:

```markdown
Use `<div>` to create a block element.

```html
<div class="container">
  Content here
</div>
```

2. The rule is case-insensitive, so both `<DIV>` and `<div>` will be detected.

3. Self-closing tags like `<br/>` are also detected.

4. The rule checks for HTML tags with attributes (e.g., `<div class="container">`).

5. The rule identifies both opening and closing tags as separate instances.
