# MD025 - Single Title/Heading Level at the Beginning of a Document

## Description

This rule is triggered when a document contains multiple top-level headings (such as H1 in HTML). Having multiple top-level headings can confuse readers and automated tools, as the first heading is typically treated as the document title. For better document structure and SEO, a document should generally have only one top-level heading.

The rule can be configured to check for different heading levels (not just H1) and to consider the presence of a title in front matter as counting toward the single title limit.

## Configuration

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `level` | The heading level to consider as the top level | `1` |
| `front_matter_title` | The front matter title field to check for | `"title:"` |

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "MD025": {
    "level": 1,
    "front_matter_title": "title:"
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Valid

Basic document with a single top-level heading:

```markdown
# Document Title

## Section 1

Content here.

## Section 2

More content here.
```

Document with front matter title and no top-level headings:

```markdown
---
title: Document Title
---

## Section 1

Content here.

## Section 2

More content here.
```

### Invalid

Document with multiple top-level headings:

```markdown
# First Title

Content here.

# Second Title

More content.
```

Will generate a warning:
- Line 5: Multiple top-level headings (level 1) in the same document

Document with front matter title and top-level heading:

```markdown
---
title: Document Title
---

# Document Title

## Section 1

Content here.
```

Will generate a warning:
- Line 5: Multiple top-level headings (level 1) in the same document

### Fixed

Multiple top-level headings get converted to a heading structure:

```markdown
# First Title

Content here.

## Second Title

More content.
```

Front matter title with additional heading:

```markdown
---
title: Document Title
---

## Document Title

### Section 1

Content here.
```

## Special Cases

- The rule considers a front matter title as a top-level heading if the `front_matter_title` pattern is matched.
- When a front matter title exists, the first heading of the specified level is considered redundant.
- The fix automatically downgrades additional top-level headings by increasing their level (adding one `#`).
- The rule works with both ATX style (`# Heading`) and Setext style (`Heading\n=======`) headings.
- Indented headings are also checked.
