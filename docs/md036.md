# MD036 - No emphasis used instead of headings

## Description

This rule is triggered when emphasis (italics or bold) is used on an entire line, suggesting it might be intended as a heading.

Emphasis is typically used to highlight specific words or phrases within text, not to create section titles. Using proper heading syntax (`#` for ATX headings or underlines for Setext headings) improves document structure and accessibility.

## Configuration

There are no configuration options for this rule.

## Examples

### Invalid

```markdown
*This is emphasized but should be a heading*
Some content under it.

**This is strongly emphasized but should be a heading**
More content here.
```

### Valid

```markdown
# This is a proper heading
Some content under it.

## Another proper heading
More content here.

This paragraph has *emphasized* text within it, which is fine.
```

### Fixed

From:
```markdown
*This is emphasized but should be a heading*
Some content under it.

**This is strongly emphasized but should be a heading**
More content here.
```

To:
```markdown
# This is emphasized but should be a heading
Some content under it.

## This is strongly emphasized but should be a heading
More content here.
```

## Special Cases

- The rule only triggers when an entire line consists of emphasized text.
- Emphasis within a line (not covering the entire line) does not trigger this rule.
- Lines that are not the first word in a paragraph do not trigger this rule.
- Emphasis inside code blocks is ignored.
- Both single emphasis (`*` or `_`) and double emphasis (`**` or `__`) are detected.
- Single emphasis is converted to H1 headings, and double emphasis to H2 headings.
