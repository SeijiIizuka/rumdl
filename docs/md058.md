# MD058 - Tables should be surrounded by blank lines

## Description

This rule is triggered when tables are not surrounded by blank lines. Adding blank lines before and after tables improves readability and helps parsers correctly identify table boundaries.

## Configuration

This rule does not have any specific configuration options. It simply checks for the presence of blank lines before and after each table in the document.

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
This is some text before the table.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |

This is some text after the table.
```

Tables at the beginning of a document don't need a preceding blank line:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |

This is some text after the table.
```

Tables at the end of a document don't need a following blank line:

```markdown
This is some text before the table.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
```

### Invalid

```markdown
This is some text before the table.
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
This is some text after the table.
```

## Special Cases

- Tables in code blocks are ignored
- A blank line is defined as a line containing no characters or only whitespace
- Tables at the beginning of a document don't need a preceding blank line
- Tables at the end of a document don't need a following blank line
- A table is identified by the presence of a delimiter row (containing dashes and optionally colons)

## Fix

When automatically fixing issues:
- A blank line will be added before a table if it's missing and the table is not at the beginning of the document
- A blank line will be added after a table if it's missing and the table is not at the end of the document

## Rationale

Adding blank lines around tables improves document readability and helps ensure that tables are correctly recognized by Markdown parsers. Without blank lines, some parsers might not correctly identify table boundaries, especially when tables are adjacent to other content.

## Benefits

- Improved readability of document content
- Better parsing consistency across Markdown processors
- Clearer visual separation between tables and surrounding content
