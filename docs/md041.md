# MD041 - First line in file should be a top level heading

## Description

This rule is triggered when the first line of a file is not a top-level heading. In most Markdown documents, the first line should be a heading that identifies the document's title or main topic.

Having a proper top-level heading provides several benefits:
- It establishes a clear document structure
- It helps with navigation when multiple Markdown files are linked together
- It improves accessibility for screen readers
- It provides a consistent experience for readers

By default, the rule expects the first heading to be a level 1 (`#`), but this can be configured to accept other heading levels.

## Configuration

This rule has two configuration options:

```json
{
  "MD041": {
    "level": 1,               // Expected heading level (1-6)
    "front_matter_title": true // Whether to consider front matter titles sufficient
  }
}
```

- `level`: Specifies the expected heading level (1-6). Default is 1.
- `front_matter_title`: If `true`, the rule will not trigger if the document contains YAML front matter with a `title` field. Default is `true`.

## Examples

### Valid

#### Standard heading at beginning of file

```markdown
# Document Title

Content starts here...
```

#### With front matter (when front_matter_title is true)

```markdown
---
title: Document Title
author: John Doe
---

Content starts here...
```

#### With custom heading level (when configured)

When `level` is set to 2:

```markdown
## Document Title

Content starts here...
```

### Invalid

#### Missing heading

```markdown
This document has no heading.

It just starts with regular paragraph text.
```

#### Wrong level heading

When `level` is set to 1:

```markdown
## Secondary Heading

This document starts with an H2 instead of an H1.
```

#### No heading after front matter (when front_matter_title is false)

When `front_matter_title` is set to `false`:

```markdown
---
title: Document Title
author: John Doe
---

Content starts here without a heading.
```

### Fixed

Original content:
```markdown
This document has no heading.

It just starts with regular paragraph text.
```

Fixed content:
```markdown
# Title

This document has no heading.

It just starts with regular paragraph text.
```

## Special Cases

1. **Empty Files**: The rule is not triggered for empty files.

2. **Front Matter**: When `front_matter_title` is set to `true` (default), files with YAML front matter containing a `title` field are considered valid even without an explicit heading.

3. **Heading Location**: The rule specifically checks for a heading at the first non-empty, non-front-matter line in the document. If any other content appears before a heading, the rule will trigger.

4. **White Space**: Blank lines at the beginning of the file are ignored when looking for the first heading.
