# MD034 - No Bare URLs

## Description

URLs should not appear as bare text in Markdown documents. Instead, they should be enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`) or formatted as proper Markdown links.

When URLs appear as bare text in Markdown documents:
- Some Markdown processors may not recognize them as clickable links
- They can break document formatting in unexpected ways
- They are less visually distinguishable from surrounding text
- They are harder to maintain and update

For proper rendering and better readability, URLs should be either:
- Enclosed in angle brackets: `<https://example.com>`
- Used in Markdown link syntax: `[Example](https://example.com)`

## Configuration

This rule has no configurable options.

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
[Example website](https://example.com)

<https://example.com>

Visit the [documentation](https://docs.example.com) for more information.

Check out our website at <https://example.com> for details.
```

### Invalid

```markdown
Visit https://example.com for more information.

For documentation, see http://docs.example.com/guide.

Check out https://example.com/products?id=123#section and purchase something.

Visit http://example.com, https://another.com, and ftp://files.example.com.
```

### Fixed

```markdown
Visit <https://example.com> for more information.

For documentation, see <http://docs.example.com/guide>.

Check out <https://example.com/products?id=123#section> and purchase something.

Visit <http://example.com>, <https://another.com>, and <ftp://files.example.com>.
```

## Special Cases

- URLs inside code blocks (fenced with ``` or ~~~) are ignored by this rule, as they're considered code examples
- URLs within inline code (surrounded by backticks) are ignored
- URLs that are already part of a Markdown link are ignored
- The rule only detects URLs that start with a protocol (http://, https://, ftp://)
- Bare domain names without protocols (e.g., example.com) are not detected as URLs by this rule
- The rule properly handles URLs with special characters, query parameters, and fragments
