# MD024 - Multiple Headings with the Same Content

## Description

This rule is triggered when a document contains multiple headings with the same text content. Having duplicate headings can be confusing for readers and can cause issues with automatically generated tables of contents, anchors, or document navigation. This rule helps maintain a clear and unique structure within your Markdown documents.

The rule can be configured to allow headings with the same content if they appear at different nesting levels, which may be appropriate in some document structures.

## Configuration

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `allow_different_nesting` | Whether to allow duplicate headings if they have different nesting levels | `false` |

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "MD024": {
    "allow_different_nesting": true
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Valid

With default configuration:

```markdown
# First Heading
Content here.

## Second Heading
More content.

# Another Unique Heading
Even more content.
```

With `allow_different_nesting: true`:

```markdown
# Heading
Content at top level.

## Heading
Content at second level (allowed because it's at a different nesting level).
```

### Invalid

```markdown
# Duplicate Heading
Content here.

## Some Other Heading
More content.

# Duplicate Heading
This will trigger a warning due to the duplicate heading.
```

Will generate a warning:
- Line 7: Duplicate heading 'Duplicate Heading' found (previous occurrence at line 1)

With `allow_different_nesting: false` (default):

```markdown
# Heading
Content at top level.

## Heading
Content at second level (still triggers warning with default config).
```

## Special Cases

- The rule compares the entire text content of the heading, ignoring any formatting or whitespace differences.
- When `allow_different_nesting` is set to `true`, headings with the same content are allowed as long as they appear at different levels (e.g., an H1 and an H2 with the same text).
- This rule has no automatic fix, as determining how to make headings unique requires human judgment.
- The rule checks both ATX-style (`# Heading`) and Setext-style (`Heading\n=======`) headings.
- Front matter is ignored by this rule.
