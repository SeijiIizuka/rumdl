# MD026 - Trailing punctuation in heading

## Description

This rule checks for headings that end with specified punctuation marks. By default, the following punctuation characters are checked: period (`.`), comma (`,`), semicolon (`;`), colon (`:`), exclamation mark (`!`), and question mark (`?`).

The rationale behind this rule is that trailing punctuation in headings is typically unnecessary and can make a document look less clean and professional. Headings are meant to be short, descriptive titles rather than complete sentences.

## Configuration

This rule can be configured with a custom string of punctuation characters to check for:

```json
{
  "punctuation": ".,;:!?"  // Default is ".,;:!?"
}
```

You can customize this to check for a subset of these characters or add other punctuation marks.

## Examples

### Valid

```markdown
# Introduction
## Project Overview
### How to Install
```

### Invalid

```markdown
# Introduction!
## Project Overview?
### How to Install.
```

The above example would generate the following warnings:
- Line 1: Trailing punctuation in heading 'Introduction!'
- Line 2: Trailing punctuation in heading 'Project Overview?'
- Line 3: Trailing punctuation in heading 'How to Install.'

### Fixed

```markdown
# Introduction
## Project Overview
### How to Install
```

## Special Cases

### Handling of Different Heading Styles

This rule applies to all heading styles:

#### ATX-style headings

```markdown
# Heading 1.  <!-- Invalid -->
## Heading 2! <!-- Invalid -->
```

#### Closed ATX-style headings

```markdown
# Heading 1! # <!-- Invalid -->
## Heading 2? ## <!-- Invalid -->
```

#### Setext-style headings

```markdown
Heading 1!    <!-- Invalid -->
=========

Heading 2?    <!-- Invalid -->
---------
```

### Handling of Custom Punctuation

If you configure the rule with a custom set of punctuation, only those characters will be checked:

```json
{
  "punctuation": "!?"
}
```

With this configuration:

```markdown
# Heading with exclamation! <!-- Invalid -->
# Heading with question?    <!-- Invalid -->
# Heading with period.      <!-- Valid (with this custom config) -->
```
