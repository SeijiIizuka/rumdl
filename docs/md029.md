# MD029 - Ordered list item prefix

## Description

This rule checks that ordered lists have a consistent prefix style. Ordered lists can use different numbering styles:

- `ordered`: Numbers in ascending order (1, 2, 3...)
- `one`: All numbers use 1 as the prefix (1, 1, 1...)
- `zero`: All numbers use 0 as the prefix (0, 0, 0...)

The default style is `ordered`, which requires a list to start at 1 and increment by 1 for each item.

This rule is focused on the appearance of ordered lists in the Markdown source, not how they render. Many Markdown renderers will automatically renumber ordered lists, but maintaining consistent numbering in the source improves readability and helps prevent confusion.

## Configuration

This rule can be configured with the following options:

```json
{
  "style": "ordered"  // Can be "ordered", "one", or "zero"
}
```

## Examples

### Valid

#### Ordered style (default)

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

```markdown
1. First level item
   1. Nested first item
   2. Nested second item
2. Second level item
```

#### One style

```markdown
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
```

#### Zero style

```markdown
0. First item
0. Second item
0. Third item
```

### Invalid

#### Ordered style

```markdown
1. First item
3. Second item
5. Third item
```

These numbers don't follow a sequential order and would be flagged.

#### One style

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

When the style is set to "one", all list items should start with "1.".

#### Zero style

```markdown
0. First item
1. Second item
2. Third item
```

When the style is set to "zero", all list items should start with "0.".

### Fixed

For "ordered" style, the rule will renumber the list items sequentially:

Before:
```markdown
1. First item
3. Second item
5. Third item
```

After:
```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

For "one" style, all items will be changed to start with "1.":

Before:
```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

After:
```markdown
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
```

## Special Cases

### Nested Lists

The rule handles nested ordered lists correctly. Each level of indentation resets the counter, so nested lists maintain their own sequence:

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Nested first item
   2. Nested second item
3. Third item
```

### Interrupted Lists

When a list is interrupted by other content (such as paragraphs or code blocks), the rule treats them as separate lists:

```markdown
1. First list item
2. Second list item

Some text here.

1. First item of second list
2. Second item of second list
```

### Mixed List Types

The rule only checks ordered lists. Unordered lists (with `*`, `-`, or `+` markers) are not affected:

```markdown
1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item
   * Unordered nested item
   * Another unordered nested item
3. Third ordered item
```
