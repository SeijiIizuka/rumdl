# MD043 - Required Heading Structure

## Description

This rule enforces a specific heading structure in Markdown documents. It checks that the headings in a document match a predefined list of headings in the exact order specified. This is useful for ensuring consistency across a collection of documents or enforcing a specific document template.

For example, you might require that all documentation files include sections like "Overview", "Installation", "Usage", and "References" in that specific order. This rule helps maintain that structure across your documentation.

If no required headings are specified, the rule is effectively disabled.

## Configuration

This rule requires configuration to specify the expected heading structure:

```json
{
  "headings": ["Introduction", "Getting Started", "Configuration", "Examples", "References"]
}
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `headings` | An array of strings representing the required headings in the document | `[]` (empty array) |

## Examples

### Valid

When configured with `headings: ["Introduction", "Getting Started", "API Reference"]`:

```markdown
# Introduction

Some introduction text here.

# Getting Started

Instructions on how to get started.

# API Reference

API documentation here.
```

### Invalid

Same configuration, but with missing or different headings:

```markdown
# Overview

Some overview text here.

# Getting Started

Instructions on how to get started.

# Examples

Some examples here.
```

Will generate warnings because:
- "Overview" is used instead of "Introduction"
- "API Reference" is missing
- "Examples" is not in the required list

### Fixed

The fix for this rule replaces the entire content with the required headings structure, but this is generally not recommended as it would remove all existing content. It's better to manually adjust the headings to match the required structure.

## Special Cases

- The rule checks the heading text, not the heading level. This means `# Introduction` and `## Introduction` would be considered the same heading.
- The rule requires exact matches, including capitalization and punctuation.
- The rule checks both ATX-style (`# Heading`) and Setext-style (`Heading\n=======`) headings.
- If no headings are specified in the configuration (empty array), the rule is disabled.
- The rule considers all headings in the document, including those in code blocks or nested structures.
